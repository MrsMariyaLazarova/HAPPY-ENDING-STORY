                                    Gary, thanks for sharing - this completely fixed my athlete's foot issue. I applied it 1-2x a day and after about a week my fungal infection is already going away. The affected area is getting smaller and the skin is turning from red to normal. The spray
                                    really helped with the itching as well. I highly recommend!</p>

                                    This stuff is life changing! I’ve been a basketball player from the early 00s. Although I always wear high quality sneakers, that I change often!!!, I suffered from athlete’s foot for nearly 15 years. Tried everything - drops, cream, gel, vinegar, coconut
                                    oil, but this didn't go away till I read your story and … gave the spray a try. The healing effect was a relief for me. The spray penetrates so fast that it didn't make me feel greasy. I would recommend this product
                                    to ANYONE who is doing sports regularly.</p>

                                    Hey, guys, it actually DOES work for onychomycosis as well! I’ve never had athletes foot in my life and it’s a blessing as I am keen on football. But I had a lot of trouble with my toenails - thickening, breaking, splitting, etc. They looked pretty much
                                    as alien's tentacles. So, I was looking at the story about Gary’s athlete’s foot wondering should I try this on my nails, as nothing prescribed by my podiatrist worked for me. Surfing through
                                    <a href="#">OnycoStop</a> website, I thought price -quality seemed quite good… I ordered, after three days I had it, and immediately began to spray my toenails. What I noticed right away is that it absorbed into the
                                    nail really quickly which was impressive, because that's where the nail fungus is! Usually, the antifungal treatments that you get from the stores don't seem to soak, but to dry "on" the nail. I've been using it for
                                    a week and the yellow coloring seems to disappear and the desired result started to appear! I noticed that my nail was clearing and the infection was resolving. So, stick with this product and you'll get clear nails
                                    too, I've seen it with my own eyes.

                                    Gary, you’re absolutely right - the proper treatment changes lives. :) I bought the spray for my boyfriend and he applies it every day, so far it has helped a lot. He also uses powder and baby soap. The infected areas used to bleed and smell bad, but
                                    now everything is fine with his feet and with his mood. So glad I helped him to get rid of his fungus issue. Thank you, Gary!</p>

                                    The spray worked for me also, but be careful - order only from the official website. I bought something that sounds almost the same from the drugstore nearby. It didn’t help me at all and I thought that I should write a bad review here, but what was my
                                    surprise when I realized that the name was different! I ordered online and got the original version of the product that gave results almost immediately. Be careful when buying a replica, choose wisely - buy only from
                                    the manufacturer!</p>

                                    are all-naturaI. From the first application I could see the difference between the spray and various anti-fungal creams I’ve tried. It soaks very well, although I've always had itchy dry feet. I've used it for a couple
                                    of days and now the fungus is gone! It’s amazing - even before the infection my feet haven’t been so smooth!</p>

                                    in a perfect circle around where that patch of flaky skin used to be. I suspected ringworm and I started applying the spray that my friend recommended after running across Gary's post. In the first couple of days, I
                                    applied it about 4 times per day, every day. My symptoms start to lessen within 2-3 days, the progress is unbelievable! I've been applying it for a week, and now I need to turn on a bright light and scan my arm to see
                                    exactly where the patch was. I’ll continue to apply until all signs of the ringworm are completely gone, and I encourage you to try it as well.

                                    for me after about five days. I’ll continue to use it - it's important to follow through with the entire product regimen though, even if things start to improve after a few days.
